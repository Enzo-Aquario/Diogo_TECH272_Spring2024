<h1>Enzo Degoh Diogo</h1>
<p>I was born in Canada in the city of Montreal where I only knew how to speak French. Back when I was living in Canada me and and my family moved to live in many different cities such as Quebec and Ontario. I made a lot of friends but also lost many due to the fact I was moving troughout the country a lot. In total I lived there for thirteen years.</p>
<p>Currently I'm 19 years old and living in the United States in the state of Maryland precisely the city of Clarksburg. <strong>I'm living with my two parents and my five younger siblings, three sisters and one brother.</strong> I am also enrolled at Montgomery College and my major is computer gaming and simulation.</p>
<p>In the future I'm hoping to be able to continue my studies in an university to become a video game critic. I also want to be able to buy an house or an appartment and a car. <em>To make it simple I want to have a stable while being able to do what i like.</em></p>
